This is a HackerNews clone built with create-react-app. A live demo is available here: https://hnreactclone.herokuapp.com

Most work is done in client side. There is not much in server side. 

The data fetching uses the [HackerNews Firebase API](https://github.com/HackerNews/API). 

Download the project and run `yarn install` to install modules. 

To start a development server, run `yarn start` in CLI. The default local URL is `http://localhost:3000`.

Css files are served in sass. Run `yarn sass` to hot reload the sass files.
